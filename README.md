# Topic Modeling Processes

## 1. LDA(Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
### LDA models documents as dirichlet mixtures of a fixed number of topics- chosen as a parameter of the model by the user- which are in turn dirichlet mixtures of words. This generates a flat, soft probabilistic clustering of terms into topics and documents into topics.

## 2. HDP(Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes)
### HDP models topics as mixtures of words, much like LDA, but rather than documents being mixtures of a fixed number of topics, the number of topics is generated by a dirichlet process, resulting in the number of topics being a random variable as well. The "hierarchical" portion of the name refers to another level being added to the generative model (the dirichlet process producing the number of topics), not the topics themselves- the topics are still flat clusterings.
